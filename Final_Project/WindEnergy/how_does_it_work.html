        Wind turbines are the evolution of the classic windmills that can be seen in more rural areas of the world. 
		They operate by using the kinetic energy of the wind, 
		which pushes the blades of the turbine and spins a motor that converts the kinetic energy into electrical energy for consumer use.

                </li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Gear Box</h4>
                    <p class="text">
					Serves the same function as a car, the rotor spins slowly as the wind pushes against it

                        <p>The wind energy also uses for windsport. 
		  A windsport is a type of sport that involves wind power. 
		  This sport involves a non-rigid airfoil like a power kite and a sail. 
		  The sport activities can be on water, on snow, on ice or even land-based sport. 
		  Windsport included kite boating, kite flying, kite landboarding, kite jumping, kite surfing, kite buggy, kite skating, windsurfing, land sailing, sailing, snowkiting and sail biking. 
		  The wind energy is a green energy that leaves no harmful residue also is a amazing way to power the sports.</p>

                        <li><h4>Powered Vehicles </h4>
                        <p >
			The wind turbines for wind powered mechanical vehicles are installed in the vehicle at its strategic point. 
		  The wind power causes the vehicle to move forward by convert wind energy into mechanical energy through belt, gears or chains.
		  Wind powered vehicles includes ventomobile, spirit of Amsterdam, greenbird and blackbird.
		  The Ventomobile is designed by University of Stuttgart students, it is a wind powered lightweight three wheeler. In August 2008, ventomobile won the Racing Aeolus at Den Helder-Netherlands at the first prize. At the Aeolus race, some universities from all around the world participate to build the fastest and best wind powered vehicle.
		 The Spirit of Amsterdam same with the Ventomobile, build by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and in 2009 and 2010 it won first place at Racing Aeolus in Denmark. Spirit of Amsterdam can drive 6.6 m/s with a 10 m/s wind.
		 Ecotricity's Greenbird vehicle was piloted and designed by Richard Jenkins. In 2009, it broke land speed world record for wind powered vehicle.
		 As an experimental land yacht, the Blackbird is built to show that it is real to sail directly downwind faster than wind.

                            <li><h4>Powered Water Pumps</h4>
                            <p>Many communities and countries have been use wind energy to power a pump water. 
		  The pump water uses to pump water out from the ground. 
		  This is simple process and used the same type of wind mill which is used in wind turbine. 
		  The difference is this wind mill does not used to rotate turbine but used to power the water pump-forcing water to pump out from the ground. 
		  The pump water that power from wind energy is a great way to help a community or village where a supply of the water is needed continuously and the area that far from a river to provide water for daily uses as well as for farming and irrigation purposes..

                            <li><h4>Powered Sea Ships</h4>
                            <p>Since the ancient time, wind energy is used to power the sailing ships in the sea. 
		Until now wind energy is the most abundant energy source. 
		This renewable energy has been use to power small ships and boats to sail, but now it uses to power a cargo ship by attaching a huge kite. 
		So with this energy dramatically reduced both fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission.

		By using wind energy to power sea ship, it is no problem where the ship direction, since a windmill can rotate 360° into the wind, so the sea ship can sail in their direction. 
		Many types can be made, include windmill only ships and hybrid ships that store wind energy from the windmill when it does not require to be propelled. 
		These ships often equipped by low-friction hull designs like multihulls or hydrofoils to reduce energy needed to power the ships. 
		The boats with no hydrofoils and equip with windmills often not sufficient to propel the craft. 
		Therefore, the windmills provide supplemental force to propulsion systems.

                        <p><strong> Clean Source of Power</strong></p>
                        <p>
							The production of wind energy is “clean”. Unlike using coal or oil, creating energy from the wind doesn’t pollute the air or require any destructive chemicals. As a result, wind energy lessens our reliance on fossil fuels from outside nations as well, which helps our national economy and offers a variety of other benefits as well.</p>

                        <p><strong>Renewable Source</strong></p>
                        <p>
							Wind is free. In the event that you live in a geological area that gets a lot of wind, it is ready and waiting. As a renewable asset, wind can never be drained like other regular, non-renewable assets. The expense of delivering wind energy has dropped fundamentally lately, and as it becomes more popular with the general population, it will just continue to be cheaper. You will recover the expense of obtaining and introducing your wind turbine over time.</p>

                            Wind turbines can give energy to numerous homes. You don’t actually have to possess a wind turbine keeping in mind the end goal to harvest the profits; you can buy your power from a service organization that offers wind energy for a specific area. That means, you don’t even necessarily have to invest any cash in order to reap the benefits of wind energy for your home or business.</p>

                        <p>Land holders who rent area to wind homesteads can make a considerable amount of additional cash, and wind energy likewise makes new employments in this developing engineering field. Government organizations will also pay you if they can install wind turbines on your land. Also, in some cases, the electric company may wind up owing you. If you produce more power than you require from wind power, it may go into the general electric matrix, which in turn will make you some extra cash. A win all around!</p>

                        <p> Wind turbines are considered by some to be incredibly attractive. The newest models don’t look like the clunky, rustic windmills of old. Instead, they are white, slick, and modern looking. That way, you don’t have to worry about them becoming an eyesore on your land. </p>

                        <p><strong>Rapid Growth and Huge Potential</strong></p>
                        <p>Wind energy has seen enormous growth in last decade. According to U.S. department of energy, cumulative wind power capacity increased by an average of 30% per year. Wind energy accounts for about 2.5% of the total worldwide electricity production. Wind turbines are available in various sizes which means vast range of people and businesses can take advantage of it to produce power for their own use or sell it to utility to reap some profits.</p>

                        <p>Wind doesn’t generally blow reliably, and turbines usually function at about 30% capacity or so. In the event that the weather is not going to support you, you may wind up without power (or at any rate you’ll need to depend on the electric company to take care of you during those times). Serious storms or high winds may cause harm to your wind turbine, particularly when they are struck by lightning.</p>
