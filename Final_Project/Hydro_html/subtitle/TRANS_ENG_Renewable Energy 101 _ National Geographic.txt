00:00
around the world renewable energy use is
00:04
on the rise and these alternative energy
00:07
sources could hold the key to combating
00:10
climate change what is renewable energy
00:19
renewable energy is generated from
00:22
sources that naturally replenish
00:24
themselves and never run out the most
00:27
common sources are solar wind hydro
00:31
geothermal and biomass over 80% of the
00:36
total energy consumed by humans is
00:39
derived from fossil fuels
00:40
however renewables are the fastest
00:44
growing source of energy in the world
00:47
renewable energy has many benefits first
00:51
it can combat climate change because it
00:54
creates no direct greenhouse gas
00:56
emissions the only emissions that they
00:59
produce are indirect meaning those that
01:01
result from manufacturing parts
01:04
installation operation and maintenance
01:06
but even those are minimal second
01:10
renewable energy can decrease pollution
01:13
and therefore reduce threats to our
01:15
health wind solar and hydroelectric
01:19
systems create no air pollution
01:21
emissions and geothermal and biomass
01:24
energy systems emissions are much lower
01:27
than non-renewable energy sources
01:30
third renewable energy is a reliable
01:33
source of power because renewable energy
01:37
sources are well renewable they will
01:40
never run out once built renewable
01:43
facilities cost very little to operate
01:46
and the fuel is often free as a result
01:49
renewable energy prices tend to be
01:52
stable over time while renewable energy
01:55
has many advantages it is not without
01:58
downsides it is difficult for renewable
02:02
energy sources to generate power on the
02:04
same large scale as fossil fuels
02:07
building wind farms and dams can disrupt
02:10
wildlife and migration patterns and lead
02:12
to ecological destruction both solar and
02:16
wind energy are intermittent they only
02:19
generate power while the sun is shining
02:21
or while the wind is blowing batteries
02:24
can store excess energy for later use
02:27
however they are often costly while
02:31
renewable energy presents some
02:33
challenges
02:34
it also offers an environmentally
02:36
friendly alternative to the greenhouse
02:38
gas emissions and pollution of fossil
02:40
fuels
02:42
and as advances in technology make
02:44
renewable energy more accessible
02:46
affordable and efficient an end to
02:49
climate change could be within our reach
02:52
