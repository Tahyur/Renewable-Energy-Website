                    <h4>Photovoltaic solar panels</h4>
                    <p class="text">Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are made up of many solar cells. Solar cells are made of silicon, like semiconductors.
  They are constructed with a positive layer and a negative layer,
  which together create an electric field, just like in a battery.
When photons hit a solar cell, they knock electrons loose from their atoms.
  If conductors are attached to the positive and negative sides of a cell, it forms an electrical circuit.
   When electrons flow through such a circuit, they generate electricity. Multiple cells make up a solar panel,
  and multiple panels (modules) can be wired together to form a solar array.
                        The more panels you can deploy, the more energy you can expect to generate.</p>

                    <h4>Inverters</h4>
                    <p class="text">	
A solar inverter takes the DC electricity from the solar array and uses that to create AC electricity.
Inverters are like the brains of the system. Along with inverting DC to AC power,
 they also provide ground fault protection and system stats including voltage and current on AC and DC circuits,
  energy production, and maximum power point tracking.

                <li><h4>Putting it all together,</h4>
                    <p class="text">
First, sunlight hits a solar panel on the roof. The panels convert the energy to DC current, which flows to an inverter.
 The inverter converts the electricity from DC to AC, which you can then use to power your home.
It’s beautifully simple and clean, and it’s getting more efficient and affordable all the time.

                        <li><h4>Solar Water Heating</h4>
                        <p>A solar water heating unit comprises a blackened flat plate metal collector with an associated
          metal tubing facing the general direction of the sun.
          The plate collector has a transparent glass cover above and a layer of thermal insulation beneath it.
        The metal tubing of the collector is connected by a pipe to an insulated tank that stores hot water during cloudy days.
        The collector absorbs solar radiations and transfers the heat to the water circulating through the tubing either by gravity or by a pump. This hot water is supplied to the storage tank via the associated metal tubing.
        This system of water heating is commonly used in hotels, guest houses, tourist bungalows, hospitals, canteens
          as well as domestic and industrial units.</p>

                        <li><h4>Solar Heating of building </h4>
                        <p >
Solar energy can be used for space heating of buildings in many ways namely:
(a) Collecting the solar radiation by some element of the building itself i.e. solar energy is admitted directly
into the building through large South-facing windows.
(b) Using separate solar collectors which may heat either water or air or storage devices which can accumulate the
collected solar energy for use at night and during inclement days.
When the building requires heat then from these collectors or storage devices,
the heat is transferred by conventional equipment such as fan, ducts, air out¬lets, radiators and hot air registers etc.
 to warm up the living spaces of a build¬ing.
When the building does not require heat, the heated air or water from the collector can be moved to
 the heat storage device such as well insulated water tank or other heat holding material.
For inclement days, an auxiliary heating system using gas, oil or electricity is required as a backup system.

                            <li><h4>Solar Pumping</h4>
                            <p>In solar pumping, the power generated by solar-energy is utilized for pumping water for irrigation purposes.
 The requirement for water pumping is greatest in the hot summer months which coincide with the increased
 solar radiations during this period and so this method is most appropriate for irrigation purpose.
 During periods of inclement weather when solar radiations are low then the requirement for water pumping
 is also relatively less as the transpiration losses from the crops are also low.

                            <li><h4>Solar Green Houses</h4>
                            <p>A green house is a structure covered with transparent material (glass or plastic) that acts as a solar collector
  and utilises solar radiant energy to grow plants. It has heating, cooling and ventilating devices for controlling
  the temperature inside the green house.
  Solar radiations can pass through the green house glazing but the thermal radiations emitted by the objects within
   the green house cannot escape through the glazed surface. As a result, the radiations get trapped within the green
    house and result in an increase in temperature.
  As the green house structure has a closed boundary, the air inside the greenhouse gets enriched with CO2 as there
  is no mixing of the greenhouse air with the ambient air. Further, there is reduced moisture loss due to restricted
   transpiration. All these features help to sustain plant growth throughout the day as well as during the night and
    all year round.

                        <p><strong> Solar power helps to slow/stop global warming.</strong></p>
                        <p>Global warming threatens the survival of human society, as well as the survival of countless species. Luckily, decades (or even centuries) of research have led to efficient solar panel systems that create electricity without producing global warming pollution. Solar power is now very clearly one of the most important solutions to the global warming crisis.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Solar power saves society billions or trillions of dollars.</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Even long before society’s very existence is threatened by global warming, within the coming decades, global warming is projected to cost society trillions of dollars if left unabated. So, even ignoring the very long-term threat of societal suicide, fighting global warming with solar power will likely save society billions or even trillions of dollars.</p>

                        <p><strong>Solar power saves you money</strong></p>
                         <p>
                             Putting solar PV panels on your roof is likely to save you tens of thousands of dollars. The average 20-year savings for Americans who went solar in 2011 were projected to be a little over $20,000. In the populous states of New York, California, and Florida, the projected savings were over $30,000. In the sunny but expensive paradise known as Hawaii, the projected savings were nearly $65,000!s </p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Solar power provides energy reliability.</strong></p>
                        <p>The rising and setting of the sun is extremely consistent. All across the world, we know exactly when it will rise and set every day of the year. While clouds may be a bit less predictable, we do also have fairly good seasonal and daily projections for the amount of sunlight that will be received in different locations.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Solar power provides energy security.</strong></p>
                        <p> On top of the above reliability benefit, no one can go and buy the sun or turn sunlight into a monopoly. Combined with the simplicity of solar panels, this also provides the notable solar power advantage of energy security, something the US military has pointed out for years, and a major reason why it is also putting a lot of its money into the development and installation of solar power systems.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Solar power provides energy independence.</strong></p>
                        <p>Similar to the energy security boost, solar power provides the great benefit of energy independence. Again, the “fuel” for solar panels cannot be bought or monopolized. It is free for all to use. Once you have solar panels on your roof, you have an essentially independent source of electricity that is all yours. This is important for individuals, but also for cities, counties, states, countries, and even companies.</p>

                    <p><strong> Cost</strong></p>
                        <p>The initial cost of purchasing a solar system is fairly high. Although the UK government has introduced some schemes for encouraging the adoption of renewable energy sources, for example, the Feed-in Tariff, you still have to cover the upfront costs. This includes paying for solar panels, inverter, batteries, wiring and for the installation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Weather Dependent</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Although solar energy can still be collected during cloudy and rainy days, the efficiency of the solar system drops. Solar panels are dependent on sunlight to effectively gather solar energy. Therefore, a few cloudy, rainy days can have a noticeable effect on the energy system. You should also take into account that solar energy cannot be collected during the night.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Uses a Lot of Space</strong></p>
                         <p>
                             The more electricity you want to produce, the more solar panels you will need because you want to collect as much sunlight as possible. Solar panels require a lot of space and some roofs are not big enough to fit the number of solar panels that you would like to have. An alternative is to install some of the panels in your yard but they need to have access to sunlight. Anyways, If you don’t have the space for all the panels that you wanted, you can just get a fewer and they will still be satisfying some of your energy needs. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Associated with Pollution</strong></p>
                        <p>Although pollution related to solar energy systems is far less compared to other sources of energy, solar energy can be associated with pollution. Transportation and installation of solar systems have been associated with the emission of greenhouse gases. There are also some toxic materials and hazardous products used during the manufacturing process of solar photovoltaics, which can indirectly affect the environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Solar Energy Storage Is Expensive</strong></p>
                        <p> Solar energy has to be used right away, or it can be stored in large batteries. These batteries, used in off-the-grid solar systems, can be charged during the day so that the energy is used at night. This is a good solution for using solar energy all day long but it is also quite expensive. In most cases, it is smarter to just use solar energy during the day and take energy from the grid during the night.
